  <h1>Gugly</h1>

  <p>HTML contains several elements that allow you to properly structure and format your content which we'll cover later, as I just said. Now, I'm going to wrap this in a paragraph tag. So instead of a heading tag, I'm going to make sure that this is all wrapped in a paragraph tag. If I can save this, go back to my preview and now I can find my paragraph. Now, don't worry about that blue line. The only reason that is showing there is because I have this text either highlighted or focused. If I click off of it and go back to it, you can kind of see how it looks like without that content being focused on.</p>
